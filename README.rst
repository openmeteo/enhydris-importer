Enhydris-importer
=================

This is intended to be a one-off script (actually a module plus a
Django management command) to import data from files into Enhydris.
The format of the files should be that specified in
http://hydroscope.gr/, Documents, Data entry standardization.

The script is made for a particular job related to the Hydroscope
project, and some details are hardwired in the code. However, parts of
it may be suitable for reuse.
